title:  Symfony Best Practices
summary: |
    I want to show you some of my favorite parts of the new
    Symfony best practices. The aim is to keep our applications
    as simple as possible by avoiding unnecessary files and extra
    directories. It might be shocking at first, but I think
    you'll like it :).
